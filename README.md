## Branching Strategy Plan 📂​

​

To maintain an efficient workflow, we use the following Git branching strategy:​

​

### 1. **Main Branch:**​

   - This is the **production-ready** branch where stable, tested code lives.​

   - Only **approved** features and bug fixes are merged into this branch.​

​

### 2. **Feature Branches:**​

   - For each new feature, a **feature branch** is created off the `main` branch.​

   - Naming convention: `feature/feature-name`​

   - Example: `feature/user-authentication`​

   ​

### 3. **Bugfix Branches:**​

   - For fixing bugs or resolving issues, create a **bugfix branch**.​

   - Naming convention: `bugfix/bug-name`​

   - Example: `bugfix/fix-payment-errors`​

   ​

### 4. **Hotfix Branches (if needed):**​

   - In case of urgent fixes, a **hotfix branch** is created from `main`.​

   - Naming convention: `hotfix/issue-name`​

   - Example: `hotfix/critical-bug-fix`​

   ​

### 5. **Pull Requests (PRs):**​

   - Once a feature or bug fix is ready, create a **pull request** to merge it into the `main` branch.​

   - All PRs should be reviewed and approved by at least one team member before merging.​

   ​

### 6. **Squashing Commits:**​

   - Before merging a feature or bugfix branch, **squash** the commits to keep the Git history clean.​

   - This ensures that each feature appears as a single commit, making the history easier to follow.​

​

### 7. **Rebasing:**​

   - Regularly **rebase** feature branches on `main` to keep them up to date with the latest changes in the project.​

   - This minimizes merge conflicts and ensures your feature branch has the latest code.
